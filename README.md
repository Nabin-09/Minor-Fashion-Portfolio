# Minor Fashion Portfolio

This is a simple, non-responsive portfolio project that showcases the core concepts of CSS Grid layout. The project includes a GIF of a model and demonstrates how grids can be effectively used over flex for layout purposes.

## Project Overview

- **Duration**: 1-hour minor project
- **Purpose**: To clarify the usage of CSS Grids over Flexbox
- **Features**:
  - Non-responsive layout
  - Uses a GIF of a model
  - Built using CSS Grid concepts

## Why CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a powerful tool for creating complex web layouts. While Flexbox is excellent for linear, one-dimensional layouts, Grid provides more flexibility for two-dimensional layouts. This project highlights the following advantages of Grid:

1. **Two-dimensional control**: Grids allow for both rows and columns to be managed simultaneously.
2. **Alignment and spacing**: Easier to manage spaces between items and align content within cells.
3. **Explicit placement**: Items can be explicitly placed into grid areas, making the design more predictable and structured.

## Conclusion

This minor project serves as a quick demonstration of how CSS Grid can be utilized to create structured and aesthetically pleasing layouts. It provides a visual understanding of why and how Grids can be preferred over Flexbox for certain design requirements.
